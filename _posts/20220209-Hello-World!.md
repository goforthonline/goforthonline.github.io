This is a test of my fragile updates system as much as anything, but... like it says on the label, hello world!

I was originally going to develop my own Markdown-based blogging portal to manage site updates, and at some point I may end up doing that for fun and to make for better integration with the rest of my website. But at this stage it is definitely not something I should be letting myself get bogged down in as I am about nine tasks behind on my schedule as it is. So instead, this is a GitHub Pages site that is being displayed on the correct page(s) on my game website through the advanced technology of iframes.

I don't have the faintest idea how or where this is going to publish when I update the site. But IT'S AN UPDATE POST!
